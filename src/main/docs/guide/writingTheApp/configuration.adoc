Add to the `application.yml` configuration file the next block:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=security]
----
<1> Expose `/login` endpoint
<2> Expose `/oauth/access_token` endpoint as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6[section 6 of the OAuth 2.0 spec] - Refreshing an Access Token.
<3> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<4> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS)
